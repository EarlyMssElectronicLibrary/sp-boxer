## Sinai Palimpsests Data

This data set includes all captured and processed data from the
spectral imaging of Palimpsest folios from manuscripts in the
Library of the Holy Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai (the Sinai
Palimpsests Project).

Doug — I am suggesting “folios” throughout, whereas the ReadMe mixed folios and leaves.  

## 1 Sinai Palimpsest: @SHELF_MARK@

This data set contains images of a manuscript digitally imaged during
the Sinai Palimpsests Project between 2009 and 2016 and supporting
metadata. For each folio, a comprehensive set of registered TIFF
images with metadata is provided of the palimpsest folios imaged.
These images may not represent all folios from the manuscript.  During this project typically only folios recognized as palimpsested are imaged.

Doug — the previous version of the above paragraph referred to a dataset of a selected language or script.  We have never limited the folios of a manuscript we image to those of a particular language and script.  Therefore, could a dataset delivered to UCLA be a TLG and not a whole manuscript?  Is that what the language here intended?  

## 3 Intended Audience and Consumers

This data set is intended to serve the preservation of
cultural heritage for future generations of monks, students, scholars,
scientists and the general public and to support online access.

Doug — “General public” is important to Arcadia.  

- MB: Main lighting panels are mounted about 70 degrees above the
  manuscript on each side, with both lights used simultaneously

- RS, RE: The raking panels are mounted about 15 degrees above the
  manuscript on the "south" and "east" sides of the scene, with only
  one panel on for each exposure.

Doug — These two describe the cradle configuration and not the copystand.  On the copystand, the MB panels are “about 45 degrees above the manuscript on each side” and the raking lights are “on the “northeast” and “southwest” sides of the scene.”  I did not input a change to either of these two paragraphs.  

The illuminations used to produce each image are cited in the
filename (see below). Each group of capture images is a sequence of registered
exposures referred to here as a 'shot sequence'. Each palimpsest folio
side is captured in at least one shot sequence. Rarely a folio side
will have more than one shot sequence. Each of the twenty-eight to thirty-three
exposures represents a different combination of illumination
wavelength, light panel(s), and capture filter. This information is
encoded in the `CAPTURE_DESCRIPTOR`.  The capture description is one
of the following symbols:

Doug — 28 to 33 images includes all imaging sequences from the pilot project until today.  

 - WBRBG58 - main panel, 445 nm, royal blue (RB) illumination, with
    green #58 filter (G58)

  - WBRBO22 - main panel, 445 nm, royal blue illumination, with
    orange #22 filter (O22)

- WBRBR28 - main panel, 445 nm, royal blue illumination, with
    red #28 filter (R28)

  - WBUVB47 - main panel, 365 nm, ultraviolet (UV) illumination, with
    blue #47 filter (B47)

  - WBUVG58 - main panel, 365 nm, ultraviolet illumination, with
    green #58 filter (G58)

  - WBUVO22 - main panel, 365 nm, ultraviolet illumination, with
    orange #22 filter (O22)

- WBUVR28 - main panel, 365 nm, ultraviolet illumination, with
    red #28 filter (R28)

  - WBUVUVb - main panel, 365 nm, ultraviolet illumination, with
    ultraviolet blocking filter

  - WBUVUVP - main panel, 365 nm, ultraviolet illumination, with
    ultraviolet pass-through filter (UVP)

Doug — Here I added R28 filter images with RB and UV illumination.  Also, the RB filter image listings ended with the filter ID in parentheses, but the UV filter image listings did not.  I added these to the UV filter image listings.   I need to check that “R28” is the correct identifier for the red filter.
